# Check-Point-dynamic-objects
Examples for creating and auditing dynamic objects

Dynamic object types offer a flexible way to update attributes used in access policies in a way that allows them to be updated using automation logic.  The ability to make ongoing changes to these object types sets them apart from traditional static objects and allows organizations flexibility with regard to changes associated with their applications and network infrastructure.
